Dependencies
- NodeJS
- node-gyp
- Please check the dependencies for this tool at: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
- Windows users will need the options for c# and c++ installed with their visual studio instance.
- Python 2.x
- OpenSSL - This is only required to build the bcrypt project if you are using versions <= 0.7.7. Otherwise, we're using the builtin node crypto bindings for seed data (which use the same OpenSSL code paths we were, but don't have the external dependency).

- Install node-gyp
npm install -g node-gyp

- install bcrypt
npm install bcrypt

if windows user n install visual studio
npm install bcrypt --msvs_version=2013

Note: OS X users using Xcode 4.3.1 or above may need to run the following command in their terminal prior to installing if errors occur regarding xcodebuild: sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
